# 2chSlackChatHistory

Saving Slack's Chat History in 2ch format 

This is a small tool in order to save the chat history of slack.   
It is written in Python by the Python rookie @terry182

##But why it is in 2ch format ?
*  The author of this is project is an "otaku"
*  Read the point above

##Usage
*  Can't think of how to use right now
*  Edit the variables in `main.py`.

##In Progress
- [ ] GUI supported
- [ ] Chat log compression
